----------
Types of function 
1. Inbuilt function
2. User Defined function
-------------------------

Built in --> 
1. abs()
    It ignores the negative part of the value
    it does not convert it ignores
2. all()
    #return value of all() function
     when the values inside the list are all true then it will print true
     0 is a false number
     an empty list is also considered true
     if(false,1,2)---> in case = false 
3. dir()
    #directory..
    there is given list of numbers ,the number of operation that can be done on it ---that same directory is returned
4. divmod()
    Given two numbers and then returns the pair as(qoitient, reminder)
    print(divmod(9,2))
5. enumerate()
    using this you  can start the indexing from anywhere 
    used in the leader board making 
6. filter()
   conditionally apply the filter to get the rquired output
7. isinstance()
   
8. map()
   map applies a function to all the items in an input_list.
9. reduce()
   reduce() function is for computing some computation on a list and returning the result.
   it does the computation all at once not one by one

     User Defined function 
    ----------------------
1.  Function argument
2.   Keyword argument
3.   Default argument
4.   arbitary arguments
5.    when we do not know about the number of argument to be passed so we use arbitary arguments .

Recursion
(to do for solving a question) 
   # Base case
   # Formula
   
ex. n x fact(n-1) work till base is 1

Lambda Function or Anonymous function 
its just like the friend function of c++
can we store a function in a variable as a helper function
can we pass function inside function
can we return a function from a function----
 this lead to function programming
 used in pandas
   double = Lambda x:x*2
   print(double(5))
   it creates a function internally in div of type double

   lst=[1,2,3,4,5]
   even_lst=list(filter(lambda x:(x%2==0),lst))
   print(even_lst)

   -----------------------------------------------
   *  Python Functions
Function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.

It avoids repetition and makes code reusable.

Syntax:
def function_name(parameters):

    """
    Doc String
    """

    Statement(s)
keyword "def" marks the start of function header

Parameters (arguments) through which we pass values to a function. These are optional

A colon(:) to mark the end of funciton header

Doc string describe what the function does. This is optional

"return" statement to return a value from the function. This is optional
Function Call
Once we have defined a function, we can call it from anywhere
Doc String
The first string after the function header is called the docstring and is short for documentation string.

Although optional, documentation is a good programming practice, always document your code

Doc string will be written in triple quotes so that docstring can extend up to multiple lines

return Statement
The return statement is used to exit a function and go back to the place from where it was called.

Syntax:

return [expression]
-> return statement can contain an expression which gets evaluated and the value is returned.

-> if there is no expression in the statement or the return statement itself is not present inside a function, then the function will return None Object

Scope and Life Time of Variables
-> Scope of a variable is the portion of a program where the variable is recognized

-> variables defined inside a function is not visible from outside. Hence, they have a local scope.

-> Lifetime of a variable is the period throughout which the variable exits in the memory.

-> The lifetime of variables inside a function is as long as the function executes.

-> Variables are destroyed once we return from the function.

Example:


-------------------------------------------------
Renaming the module at the time of import(module aliasing)
  test.py
import simplemath as m
   print(m.x)
   m.add(10,20)
   m.product(10,20)

   specifically only add and print value of x so do-->
   from import
   from simplemath import x,add
   print(x)
   add(10,20)

   product(10,20) ---name error:name 'product not defined'

   various possibilities of import
   import modulename
   import module1,mod2,mod3
   from module import member
   from module import member1,member2,member3
   from module import member1 as x
   from module import *

   DSA in Python
   starting from the list,tuple,set,string,dictonaries-->
   then the file handling
